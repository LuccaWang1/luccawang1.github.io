                            3 Main Points of Centralized Configuration Management
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Recently, I had the privilege of working on <span class="roboto-bold">application security</span>. I made any variables that contain <span class="roboto-bold">secrets, keys, or information that could be exploited</span> for malicious attacks or configuration hacking into an environment variable. In a scalable program, the settings file is a great place to start. Streamlining the workflow of accessing data stored in the <span class="roboto-bold">environment variables</span> is important, too. The truth is that isn't not a one-and-done process - <span class="roboto-bold">it's about maintenance that brings value to the product.</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="roboto-bold">Loading environment variables in a single file</span> and then <span class="roboto-bold">importing them where needed</span> is a key best practice. The main benefit of this approach is centralized configuration management. It ensures consistency, simplifies maintenance, and provides <span class="roboto-bold">better control over environment variables across the application</span>. Here's a brief break down of a few specific benefits:  
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <span class="roboto-bold">Single Source of Truth:</span> Loading and centralizing environment variables in <span class="roboto-bold">one place</span>, like a dedicated configuration file, or settings file, <span class="roboto-bold">ensures all parts of the application are using the same values</span>. This <span class="roboto-bold">minimizes the risk of inconsistencies or errors</span>.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <span class="roboto-bold">Easier Maintenance:</span> A clear, consistent <span class="roboto-bold">structure</span> for managing environment variables simplifies the workflow for developers and makes it <span class="roboto-bold">easier to update, add, or remove</span> variables. This structure enhances security and protects keys while improving the overall maintainability of the app. (Even if the process isn't "perfect," it's still better to have some type of process than not.)
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <span class="roboto-bold">Consistency:</span> Centralizing loading of the environment variables <span class="roboto-bold">ensures that changes to them</span> (e.g. from development to production environments) <span class="roboto-bold">are handled consistently</span>. It can also help with the organization of switching keys. A well-defined process for managing and protecting the keys also <span class="roboto-bold">sets a standard for how developers should access environment variables</span>, promoting <span class="roboto-bold">cohesion across the application</span>.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p> 
                            Taking these considerations into account — protecting sensitive information through environment variables and implementing centralized configuration management — leads to <span class="roboto-bold">enhanced security, scalability, maintainability, and efficiency</span>. Recently, I've found it particularly interesting to explore aspects of <span class="roboto-bold">software development security</span>, especially as I believe it will become more ingrained in the development process due to the rise of cyber threats and a deeper understanding of cyber attack strategies.

                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            I hadn't encountered the term, or job title, "<span class="roboto-bold">developer advocate</span>" until my now-friend <span class="roboto-bold">Semona Igama</span> generously volunteered her time to speak to my software engineering bootcamp cohort at Hackbright Academy about her current developer advocate role at Okta. I'm grateful to Semona for giving back to a community that helped her start her own career in the tech industry, especially since she's been a friend and mentor to me ever since.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As an Okta developer advocate in Okta's <span class="roboto-bold">Identity Standards</span> department, <span class="roboto-bold">she recently interviewed Okta Director of Identity Standards Aaron Parecki about OAuth Global Token Revocation specification</span> that's part of the OAuth 2.0 framework at <span class="roboto-bold">Okta's dev_day(24)</span>. It outlines a standard way to revoke access tokens globally across different services or applications, and she did a fantastic job of guiding the conversation with her strategically outlined questions.

                            They talked about the new protocol and explained how it can effectively <span class="roboto-bold">solve key enterprise security breach scenarios</span>, which I found to be interesting. As a software developer, I think it's important to be open to new information and all things surrounding software development since security is inevitably part of developing software. So I appreciated Semona sharing with me about the event prior to the event, so I could sit in on that conversation.

                        </h3>

                        <h4>
                            Inline v. CSS 
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Before my transition to Software Engineering last year, I was an email developer, using Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="roboto-bold">HTML</span>) to code nonprofit and political fundraising emails for clients across the nation. (Being an email developer was part of my job, which was centered on communications and digital media.) Technologies: I used Notepad++, HTML, AWS S3, an SQL database and email client ActionKit, and also MailChimp, and before that, ConstantContact. The <span class="roboto-bold">inline styling</span> is not the templates used for the emails - but rather the inline styling was used for the body of the emails.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What does this mean? Well, I coded the emails mostly with inline styling, as opposed to what I use now as an engineer: I now mostly use <span class="roboto-bold">CSS</span> (95% of the time). 
                        </p> 
                            
                        <p>
                            Why is that? It's because the emails were one-off (even if we might send 4 emails for one client in 1 day). By doing inline styling, you're able to customize each email according to the design and style, which reflects the content and needs/purpose of sending the (individual) email. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Why is this different from API, application, websites, etc.? (AKA: Why do I use CSS 95% of the time - as opposed to inline HTML styling - in my projects now as a software engineer?) It's different, because when you have a <span class="roboto-bold">whole project</span>, you want it to be <span class="roboto-bold">consistent</span> - in design style, writing style, coding style, and more. So, when you have a stylesheet that indicates how everything on your website should look, you have a centralized place of the styles, and it tells all the same elements on the website to do that same thing. (For instance, I have a certain size and color + CSS animation for my h2 headers on my portfolio website. Because of CSS' centralized stylesheet, all the h2 headers on my portfolio website are the same font size, the same color, and have the same animation on them. This way, the viewer/user of the website knows when they see it that that's a subheader, like the one they saw that looked like it before. This consistency increases readability and usability.)

                        <p>
                             My cooking hobby and developer skills collided in the wild the other Friday night when I was searching Google for a chicken cacciatore recipe... The chosen recipe's website was <span class="roboto-bold">so slowed by ads and bugs</span>, it was <span class="roboto-bold">unable to load.</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="roboto-bold">As a software developer, I know the obvious place to look for bugs.</span> And there were tons of grubs under that log - as seen in the screenshot attached, which only shows 1/20 (one twentieth) of the total bugs showing in the <span class="roboto-bold">inspector</span>.
                        </p>

                            My cooking <span class="roboto-bold">solution</span>: I found a different recipe on another, <span class="roboto-bold">working website</span>. It's awesome to monetize, but be careful how you do it.

                        I'm digging into <span class="roboto-bold">Generative AI</span> by listening to O'Reilly's "Generative AI in the Real World" <a target="_blank" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/generative-ai-in/0642572068790/">podcast</a> by Ben Lorica - today, with Tim Persons of Pricewaterhouse&shy;Coopers (PwC).

                    <ul>Some of the <span class="roboto-bold">takeaways</span>: 
                        <li>
                            Budgets are increasing for Generative AI.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Teams should aim for a high failure rates to push themselves quickly enough.

                        <li>
                            Because of technology advance&shy;ment, we can infor&shy;mation share and really learn a lot, which levels the playing field for positions that might have been formerly reserved for PhDs from top schools specializ&shy;ing in certain subjects.
