                        </h3>

                        <h4>
                            Inline v. CSS 
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Before my transition to Software Engineering last year, I was an email developer, using Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="roboto-bold">HTML</span>) to code nonprofit and political fundraising emails for clients across the nation. (Being an email developer was part of my job, which was centered on communications and digital media.) Technologies: I used Notepad++, HTML, AWS S3, an SQL database and email client ActionKit, and also MailChimp, and before that, ConstantContact. The <span class="roboto-bold">inline styling</span> is not the templates used for the emails - but rather the inline styling was used for the body of the emails.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What does this mean? Well, I coded the emails mostly with inline styling, as opposed to what I use now as an engineer: I now mostly use <span class="roboto-bold">CSS</span> (95% of the time). 
                        </p> 
                            
                        <p>
                            Why is that? It's because the emails were one-off (even if we might send 4 emails for one client in 1 day). By doing inline styling, you're able to customize each email according to the design and style, which reflects the content and needs/purpose of sending the (individual) email. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Why is this different from API, application, websites, etc.? (AKA: Why do I use CSS 95% of the time - as opposed to inline HTML styling - in my projects now as a software engineer?) It's different, because when you have a <span class="roboto-bold">whole project</span>, you want it to be <span class="roboto-bold">consistent</span> - in design style, writing style, coding style, and more. So, when you have a stylesheet that indicates how everything on your website should look, you have a centralized place of the styles, and it tells all the same elements on the website to do that same thing. (For instance, I have a certain size and color + CSS animation for my h2 headers on my portfolio website. Because of CSS' centralized stylesheet, all the h2 headers on my portfolio website are the same font size, the same color, and have the same animation on them. This way, the viewer/user of the website knows when they see it that that's a subheader, like the one they saw that looked like it before. This consistency increases readability and usability.)

                        The Future PwC's Tim Persons Sees w/ GenAI
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        I'm digging into <span class="roboto-bold">Generative AI</span> by listening to O'Reilly's "Generative AI in the Real World" <a target="_blank" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/generative-ai-in/0642572068790/">podcast</a> by Ben Lorica - today, with Tim Persons of Pricewaterhouse&shy;Coopers (PwC).
                    </p>

                    <ul>Some of the <span class="roboto-bold">takeaways</span>: 
                        <li>
                            Budgets are increasing for Generative AI.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Teams should aim for a high failure rates to push themselves quickly enough.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Because of technology advance&shy;ment, we can infor&shy;mation share and really learn a lot, which levels the playing field for positions that might have been formerly reserved for PhDs from top schools specializ&shy;ing in certain subjects.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
