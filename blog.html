                        <p>
                            Recently, I contributed to the <span class="roboto-bold">full-stack development</span> and support of a robust web application in <span class="roboto-bold">Enterprise</span>, working on both <span class="roboto-bold">frontend</span> and <span class="roboto-bold">backend</span> repositories. My tech <a href="https://luccawang.dev/index.html#skills-anchor">stack</a> included <span class="roboto-bold">Python</span>, <span class="roboto-bold">Django</span>, <span class="roboto-bold">React</span>, and our old friend <span class="roboto-bold">HTML</span>. I also gained experience working with <span class="roboto-bold">Docker</span>, <span class="roboto-bold">AWS ECS</span>, <span class="roboto-bold">EC2</span>, and <span class="roboto-bold">IAM</span>, along with <a href="https://luccawang.dev/index.html#skills-anchor">tools</a> and libraries like <span class="roboto-bold">Postman</span>, <span class="roboto-bold">MySQL</span>, and <span class="roboto-bold">Material UI</span>.

I leveraged <span class="roboto-bold"><a href="https://luccawang.dev/index.html#skills-anchor">Python's</a> Levenshtein module</span> (<span class="roboto-bold">Levenshtein Distance</span>) and <span class="roboto-bold">variance threshold algorithms</span> to catch common issues like typos or duplicate entries in both the <span class="roboto-bold">frontend</span> and <span class="roboto-bold">backend</span>. This ensured better <span class="roboto-bold">data accuracy</span> and cleanliness within the <span class="roboto-bold">relational database</span>. It prevented duplicate entries of multiple different types of items/objects in the database. This also decreased the need for more future maintenance that might be due to duplications of data in the database.

                        <p>
                            I hadn't encountered the term, or job title, "<span class="roboto-bold">developer advocate</span>" until my now-friend <span class="roboto-bold">Semona Igama</span> generously volunteered her time to speak to my software engineering bootcamp cohort at Hackbright Academy about her current developer advocate role at Okta. I'm grateful to Semona for giving back to a community that helped her start her own career in the tech industry, especially since she's been a friend and mentor to me ever since.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As an Okta developer advocate in Okta's <span class="roboto-bold">Identity Standards</span> department, <span class="roboto-bold">she recently interviewed Okta Director of Identity Standards Aaron Parecki about OAuth Global Token Revocation specification</span> that's part of the OAuth 2.0 framework at <span class="roboto-bold">Okta's dev_day(24)</span>. It outlines a standard way to revoke access tokens globally across different services or applications, and she did a fantastic job of guiding the conversation with her strategically outlined questions.

                            They talked about the new protocol and explained how it can effectively <span class="roboto-bold">solve key enterprise <a href="https://luccawang.dev/blog.html#blog-post-centralized-configuration-management">security</a> breach scenarios</span>, which I found to be interesting. As a software developer, I think it's important to be open to new information and all things surrounding software development since security is inevitably part of developing software. So I appreciated Semona sharing with me about the event prior to the event, so I could sit in on that conversation.

                        </h3>

                        <h4>
                            Inline v. CSS 
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Before my transition to Software Engineering last year, I was an email developer, using Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="roboto-bold">HTML</span>) to code nonprofit and political fundraising emails for clients across the nation. (Being an email developer was part of my job, which was centered on communications and digital media.) Technologies: I used Notepad++, HTML, <a href="https://luccawang.dev/index.html#index-skills-CICD">AWS</a> S3, an SQL database and email client ActionKit, and also MailChimp, and before that, ConstantContact. The <span class="roboto-bold">inline styling</span> is not the templates used for the emails - but rather the inline styling was used for the body of the emails.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What does this mean? Well, I coded the emails mostly with inline styling, as opposed to what I use now as an <a href="https://luccawang.dev/built.html#swe-author-note">engineer</a>: I now mostly use <span class="roboto-bold">CSS</span> (95% of the time). 
                        </p> 
                            
                        <p>
                            Why is that? It's because the emails were one-off (even if we might send 4 emails for one client in 1 day). By doing inline styling, you're able to customize each email according to the design and style, which reflects the content and needs/purpose of sending the (individual) email. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Why is this different from API, application, websites, etc.? (AKA: Why do I use CSS 95% of the time - as opposed to inline HTML styling - in my projects now as a software engineer?) It's different, because when you have a <span class="roboto-bold">whole project</span>, you want it to be <span class="roboto-bold">consistent</span> - in design style, writing style, coding style, and more. So, when you have a stylesheet that indicates how everything on your website should look, you have a centralized place of the styles, and it tells all the same elements on the website to do that same thing. (For instance, I have a certain size and color + <a href="https://luccawang.dev/index.html#skills-anchor">CSS</a> animation for my h2 headers on my portfolio website. Because of CSS' centralized stylesheet, all the h2 headers on my portfolio website are the same font size, the same color, and have the same animation on them. This way, the viewer/user of the website knows when they see it that that's a subheader, like the one they saw that looked like it before. This consistency increases readability and usability.)

                        <p>
                             My cooking hobby and developer skills collided in the wild the other Friday night when I was searching Google for a chicken cacciatore recipe... The chosen recipe's website was <span class="roboto-bold">so slowed by ads and bugs</span>, it was <span class="roboto-regular-italic">unable to load.</span>
                        </p>

                            Because of technology advance&shy;ment, we can infor&shy;mation share and really learn a lot, which levels the playing field for positions that might have been formerly reserved for PhDs from top schools specializ&shy;ing in certain subjects.
